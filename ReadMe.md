## Gas station 

Write a microservice that retrieves the current gas station data on every start 
and prepares them to be stored in a database (only open station).

### Functions

* Search gas station by name


### Requirements 
* Use Spring Boot
* Create REST endpoints accordingly
* Add documentation to README.md to explain how to build, start and access the service
